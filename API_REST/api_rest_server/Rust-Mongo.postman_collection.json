Switzerland (CH) is strongly\\r\\n      affected by this crisis too. Eight percent of asylum requests in 2016 were made by people\\r\\n      from Syria (2015: 12 %). More than 7'000 asylum seekers from Syria entered CH over the last\\r\\n      two years. Due to the ongoing war in this region, it is unlikely that this kind of migration\\r\\n      and flight will stop. Notably, 50% of the refugee population are children and adolescents.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Refugees have typically been exposed to multiple stressors related to war and displacement\\r\\n      including loss of family members, destruction of homes and livelihoods and human rights\\r\\n      violations such as sexual violence or torture. They have often undertaken a risky and\\r\\n      stressful flight leaving their homes for an unknown future. Accordingly, studies consistently\\r\\n      show that refugees are at considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including\\r\\n      depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related somatic health\\r\\n      symptoms. Recent WHO projections suggest that approximately 15-20% of Syrian refugees will\\r\\n      develop some type of mental health problem and therefore represent an enormous public mental\\r\\n      health challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n      According to the UNHCR, 86% of all displaced persons remain in conflict or neighboring\\r\\n      countries where appropriate health care is mostly not available. But also Western health\\r\\n      systems are often unable to appropriately cover the needs of this particularly vulnerable\\r\\n      population regarding prevention and treatment of mental health problems. As a response to\\r\\n      this situation, the WHO developed the low-intensity Problem Management Plus (PM+) programs, a\\r\\n      new generation of shorter, less expensive and trans-diagnostic (i.e., not specifically aimed\\r\\n      at treating a certain mental disorder) programs to reduce common mental health symptoms and\\r\\n      improve psychosocial functioning. PM+ is based on the WHO treatment guidelines for conditions\\r\\n      related to stress. PM+ is a 5-sessions intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of depression,\\r\\n      anxiety, PTSD, and related conditions, is delivered by trained non-specialized workers or lay\\r\\n      people, and is available in individual and group delivery formats for both children and\\r\\n      adults. It comprises evidence-based techniques of (a) problem solving, (b) stress management,\\r\\n      (c) behavioral activation, and (d) accessing social support. PM+ has been successfully\\r\\n      implemented in Kenya and Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The STRENGTHS (Syrian REfuGees MeNTal HealTH Care Systems) study aims at evaluating the\\r\\n      effectiveness and implementation of PM+ with Syrian refugees in different settings in low-\\r\\n      and high-resource countries. The study consortium includes international experts in the\\r\\n      domains of trauma and public mental health as well as representatives of WHO and UNHCR. The\\r\\n      Zürich study site has been consigned to examine PM+ with adult refugees in an individual\\r\\n      treatment setting in Switzerland. At the same time, similar studies in other countries will\\r\\n      be undertaken. Despite the objective of these studies to implement and evaluate the\\r\\n      effectiveness of PM+ in refugees, each research institution acts independently. Moreover, the\\r\\n      other studies will be completed in different treatment settings - i.e., in children and\\r\\n      adolescents (Lebanon), in groups (Turkey and Netherlands), and internet-delivered PM+\\r\\n      (Germany and Egypt).\\r\\n\\r\\n      To date, the feasibility of PM+ has not been investigated in a highly industrialized country,\\r\\n      such as Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the present study, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility of PM+ in Syrian\\r\\n      refugees in Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This research entails single-blind randomized controlled trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The amendment was secured by December 2018.

Switzerland (CH) is strongly\\r\\n      affected by this crisis too. Eight percent of asylum requests in 2016 were made by people\\r\\n      from Syria (2015: 12 %). More than 7'000 asylum seekers from Syria entered CH over the last\\r\\n      two years. Due to the ongoing war in this region, it is unlikely that this kind of migration\\r\\n      and flight will stop. Notably, 50% of the refugee population are children and adolescents.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Refugees have typically been exposed to multiple stressors related to war and displacement\\r\\n      including loss of family members, destruction of homes and livelihoods and human rights\\r\\n      violations such as sexual violence or torture. They have often undertaken a risky and\\r\\n      stressful flight leaving their homes for an unknown future. Accordingly, studies consistently\\r\\n      show that refugees are at considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including\\r\\n      depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related somatic health\\r\\n      symptoms. Recent WHO projections suggest that approximately 15-20% of Syrian refugees will\\r\\n      develop some type of mental health problem and therefore represent an enormous public mental\\r\\n      health challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n      According to the UNHCR, 86% of all displaced persons remain in conflict or neighboring\\r\\n      countries where appropriate health care is mostly not available. But also Western health\\r\\n      systems are often unable to appropriately cover the needs of this particularly vulnerable\\r\\n      population regarding prevention and treatment of mental health problems. As a response to\\r\\n      this situation, the WHO developed the low-intensity Problem Management Plus (PM+) programs, a\\r\\n      new generation of shorter, less expensive and trans-diagnostic (i.e., not specifically aimed\\r\\n      at treating a certain mental disorder) programs to reduce common mental health symptoms and\\r\\n      improve psychosocial functioning. PM+ is based on the WHO treatment guidelines for conditions\\r\\n      related to stress. PM+ is a 5-sessions intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of depression,\\r\\n      anxiety, PTSD, and related conditions, is delivered by trained non-specialized workers or lay\\r\\n      people, and is available in individual and group delivery formats for both children and\\r\\n      adults. It comprises evidence-based techniques of (a) problem solving, (b) stress management,\\r\\n      (c) behavioral activation, and (d) accessing social support. PM+ has been successfully\\r\\n      implemented in Kenya and Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The STRENGTHS (Syrian REfuGees MeNTal HealTH Care Systems) study aims at evaluating the\\r\\n      effectiveness and implementation of PM+ with Syrian refugees in different settings in low-\\r\\n      and high-resource countries. The study consortium includes international experts in the\\r\\n      domains of trauma and public mental health as well as representatives of WHO and UNHCR. The\\r\\n      Zürich study site has been consigned to examine PM+ with adult refugees in an individual\\r\\n      treatment setting in Switzerland. At the same time, similar studies in other countries will\\r\\n      be undertaken. Despite the objective of these studies to implement and evaluate the\\r\\n      effectiveness of PM+ in refugees, each research institution acts independently. Moreover, the\\r\\n      other studies will be completed in different treatment settings - i.e., in children and\\r\\n      adolescents (Lebanon), in groups (Turkey and Netherlands), and internet-delivered PM+\\r\\n      (Germany and Egypt).\\r\\n\\r\\n      To date, the feasibility of PM+ has not been investigated in a highly industrialized country,\\r\\n      such as Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the present study, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility of PM+ in Syrian\\r\\n      refugees in Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This research entails single-blind randomized controlled trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The amendment was secured by December 2018.
